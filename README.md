This is my repo for Codeup's Visualization and DS libraries module. The repo contains introductions to Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and seaborn, as well as a brief peek at Big O notation.

# What is Pandas?
- Pandas is defined as an open-source library that provides high-performance data manipulation in Python. It is built on top of the NumPy package, which means Numpy is required for operating the Pandas. The name of Pandas is derived from the word Panel Data and it's used for data analysis in Python. - [javatpoint.com](https://www.javatpoint.com/pandas-vs-numpy)

# What is NumPy?
- NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open source Python library that’s used in almost every field of science and engineering. It’s the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it’s at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems. NumPy users include everyone from beginning coders to experienced researchers doing state-of-the-art scientific and industrial research and development. The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages. - [numpy.org](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html)

# What's the difference between Pandas and NumPy?
- The Pandas module mainly works with the tabular data, whereas the NumPy module works with the numerical data. NumPy library provides objects for multi-dimensional arrays, whereas Pandas is capable of offering an in-memory 2d table object called DataFrame. NumPy consumes less memory as compared to Pandas. - [javatpoint.com](https://www.javatpoint.com/pandas-vs-numpy)

# What is maplotlib?
- Matplotlib is a library for making 2D plots of arrays in Python. Although it has its origins in emulating the MATLAB graphics commands, it is independent of MATLAB, and can be used in a Pythonic, object oriented way. Although Matplotlib is written primarily in pure Python, it makes heavy use of NumPy and other extension code to provide good performance even for large arrays. - [matplotlib.org](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/history.html)
